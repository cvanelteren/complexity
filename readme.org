* TODO Welcome to complexity's toolbox

Complexity  scientists  have  diverse backgrounds;  in  this
toolbox I aim to unify these disciplines and offer a sci-kit
like  experience for  complexity science.  It will  form the
flipside of the coin to [[https://github.com/cvanelteren/PlexSim/tree/master/plexsim][Plexsim]] (the computational toolbox).
** Outline
The package needs  to provide bindings to python  but can be
written in  any language  of choice  by the  programmer. The
complexity  discipline  should  be  divided  into  different
branches such  as biology, information theory,  phsycis etc.
When  adding  a   new  module  or  function   it  should  be
accompanied by  a "tutorial" outlining  its uses in  a human
readable manner (possible with math).

- [ ] take one dataset on which all these methods can be applied.
